# Week 5: Use D3 to to display the price of cocaine salts around the world

D3 is an extraordinary library from the Mike Bostock (see [some of his work for the New York Times here](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)). You can use it for displaying all sorts of graphical data, but we are going to concentrate on maps, using D3 and TopoJSON.

The task will be to take a CSV file of cocaine salt prices, both wholesale and retail, and represent those prices on a map in any way that you like. 

Start by working your way through Mike's tutorial, *[Let’s Make a Map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/)*

If you like, you can use [this minimal example of a map of the world drawn using D3](http://foundersandcoders.org/resources/d3/minimal.html) as a starting point.

If you have time, you are welcome to experiment with other data sets and other graphical representations (see [the D3 gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)).

Robin will be back on Thursday afternoon to review your work.
